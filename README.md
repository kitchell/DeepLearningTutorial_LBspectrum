# Deep Learning Tutorial - Lindsey Kitchell
This is a tutorial for combining **Deep Learning** and the **Laplace Beltrami spectrum**. This tutorial assumes some experience with python and machine learning. Experience using the machine learning modules from the python library sci-kit-learn will also be very helpful. The tutorial will be applicable beyond the Laplace Beltrami spectrum, but the data used will focus on it.

# Sources and Useful Resources

For learning about machine learning in general, I recommend this [free introductory course from udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120). It will get you up and running with machine learning in python very quickly. 

I also recommend this book by the creator of Keras (the python library used in this tutorial): [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python). It has a lot of detailed information about deep learning in general and how to implement it with Keras.
