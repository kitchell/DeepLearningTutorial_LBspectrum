# Evaluating the Neural Network

A main goal of machine learning is to create models that *generalize*, meaning that they perform well on data that has not been seen before. To test the generalization power of a model you typically need to split your available data into three separate datasets: **a training set, a validation set, and a testing set**. You then train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance with the validation data. Once the model is sufficiently accurate, you test it a final time on the testing data.
