# Loss Functions and Optimizers

When compiling your model you need to choose a loss function and an optimizer. The loss function is the quantity that will be minimized during training. The optimizer determines how the network will be updated based on the loss function. 

## Loss Functions

There are some simple guidlines for choosing the correct loss function:

**binary crossentropy** is used when you have a two-class, or binary, classification problem. 

**categorical crossentropy** is uses for a multi-class classification problem. 

**mean squared error** is used for a regression problem. 

**connectionist temporal classification** is used for a sequence learning problem. 


## Optimizers















can optimize learning rate.
