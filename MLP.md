# Multi-Layer Perceptrons: Fully Connected Neural Networks

A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a fully connected neural network, meaning that each node connects to all possible nodes in the surrounding layers. To create a MLP or fully connected neural network in Keras, you will need to use the Dense layer. The Keras documentation on the Dense layer can be found [here] (https://keras.io/layers/core/).
